# Minesweeper Unreal Engine 4 Plugin

This is just a little demo project: a playable Minesweeper game that uses Slate User Interface system.

The plugin is wrapped into a generic empty game project. If you open the MyProject.uproject file in UE4Editor, it will ask to rebuild the project. Once that's done, you should see the Minesweeper button in the top toolbar.

Pressing on that button should open a Minesweeper game window with a fully playable game. Adding flags is not implemented, but it is still playable even without them.
